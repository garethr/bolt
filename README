Bolt is a very simple tool for when you have a shell script that you would like
to be able to run from a web browser.

Details
=======

You might be thinking, isn't running a operating system command from a web page easy?
and you'd be right in thinking that it is. Presumably all programming languages
will let you do this with some OS standard library tool or another. But that's
only part of my requirement. My main secondary requirement is that I want to see
the output of the script as it happens, as if I was running it in a terminal.

This tool is something of a spinout of a bigger something I'm working on. I'm quite
likely to make this code better but less likely to add new features.


Implementation
==============

It's written as an EventMachine websocket server on the backend with a simple HTML
interface. All the communication between client and server is done using websockets,
so this will only work for supported modern browsers.

The command you acually want to run is currently stored in the included exec.sh shell
script. This has a very simple example that should run in most places just to get 
started with.

You'll need a few dependencies:

gem install eventmachine
gem install em-websocket-server

To run the server simple execute:

./server.rb


Improvements
============

I'll be writing some tests once I get my head round how to do so in EventMachine. I'll
also get bundler or similar setup so you don't have to manually install gems. More
importantly I'll abstract out some of the bits like the host and port on which the server
runs and more importantly the script or command to try and execute.
